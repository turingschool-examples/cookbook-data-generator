Pop amaranth by placing 1 tablespoon of grain in at a time, stirring constantly for about 15 seconds until seeds pop.

So I think it depends on the pan and the range you are cooking with. Dont be discouraged if the grains dont pop right away, just adjust the temperature until you find the combination that works in your kitchen.Once all your amaranth is popped, place in a shallow bowl and set aside. Now lets create a sweet banana date paste to bind our poppers. In the blender, place banana, dates and maple syrup and mix until smooth."},{"number":3,"instruction":"Pour paste into the large bowl with the nuts and mix well.
